# Exercises 2

1. The `nz_elev` raster (system.file("raster/nz_elev.tif", package = "spDataLarge")) has the resolution of 1000 by 1000 meters.
Resample the raster to the resolution of 2500 by 2500 meters, and then change the output's projection to WGS84 (EPSG: 4326).
2. Run the following code to get the `nz` object: `data(nz, package = "spData")`. 
Select the Otago region only.
Create a map of `nz_elev` with the Otago region's borders on top.
Next, crop and mask the `nz_elev` to the area of the Otago region only.
Visualize the results.
3. Read the `nz_height` object into R (`data(nz_height, package = "spData")`).
Extract the elevation values from the `nz_elev` raster to the `nz_height` points, and combine the two objects.
Compare the existing elevation column with the newly extracted values. 
Are they the same?
4. Extract elevation values for each region in New Zealand (the `nz` object). 
Which region has the highest average elevation?
5. Convert the `nz` object into a raster with a resolution of 5000 by 5000 meters.
6. Create contour lines based on `nz_elev` with five different levels of values (see the `?graphics::contour` documentation).
7. Convert the `nz_elev` object into the **stars** object. 
Where can you find the resolution and projection of the data?
8. Save the `nz_elev` object as a new GeoTIFF file named `nz_elev_fr.tif`.
