Ideas: 

- Exploring data structures based on NZ examples


- Intro to vector data with nz
  - Non spatial operations
  - Spatial operations e.g. spatial subsetting
  - Questions from the book
  
- Getting data into R:
  - Directly reading in from url
  - OSM data with osmdata and `osmextract` packages
  
  
- Advanced: transport data based on the transport chapter
